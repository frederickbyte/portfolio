✏️ [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/) | I love Andy's style and color choices for his site. He is a CSS wizard and writes often about it. Oh and _Piccalilli_ is one of the more unique names I've ever seen for a personal site. Andy has influenced some of the style decisions of this site.

✨ [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) | Josh has a unique style and is outstanding at explaining React and CSS principles.

🌟 [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) | Tania is also an excellent communicator who writes about software and her personal life. She will occasionally discuss the mental/emotional aspects of software development which I love.

📝 [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/) | Kev works in digital forensics but writes about front-end development and site hosting.

💎 [Tomek Nieżurawski](https://tomekdev.com/) | A young but interesting blog. Tomek's post on search bars allowing typo is especially interesting.

📚 [Dan Abramov](https://overreacted.io/) | Dan is a React developer who is well-versed in all things front-end.

💡 [Victor Zhou](https://victorzhou.com/) | Victor primarily writes about machine learning and neural networks. He communicates these ideas and the mathematical theory behind them excellently.
