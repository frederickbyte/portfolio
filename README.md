# Andrew Stolzle

This is my personal site which serves primarily as a space for me to write and express my ideas.

My site is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I took inspiration from Andy Bell's [eleventy-from-scratch](https://piccalil.li/course/learn-eleventy-from-scratch) course. Check it out - Andy is a great communicator and his 11ty course is excellent!
