This is my personal site which serves primarily as a space for me to write and express my ideas.

My site is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. Create a Gatsby site.

Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the blog starter.

```
# create a new Gatsby site using the blog starter
npx gatsby new my-blog-starter https://github.com/hagnerd/gatsby-starter-blog-mdx
```
2. Start developing.

Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

```
cd my-blog-starter/
gatsby develop
```

Open the source code and start editing!

The site should now be running on `http://localhost:8000`
