Ideas determine the course of history. Good ideas can bring a country unparalleled wealth and prosperity - bad ideas can destroy one. Virtuous ideas gave birth to America. We have since abandoned those ideas; as a result our country is dying.

People are more stressed, anxious, depressed, drug-addicted, and in debt than ever before. We blame each other and promise to act differently, but nothing changes. Politians make empty promises to "be better," but no substantial changes can be made until we challenge the fundamental premises by which we operate.

I hope that by sharing my ideas we can work towards curing our toxic culture and towards making life more free and more prosperous for everyone. Influencing a culture takes time. But so long as humans possess free will, we should make an effort to promote good ideas and denounce evil ones.

With this being the first of many discussions we will have, it is appropriate for me to outline my worldview and to describe the ideas that guide my life. These ideas will be apparent in future posts, but it is important to lay the groundwork before examining any specific topic. This will be a summary, not an in-depth inspection of these ideas. It would take quite a while to comprehensively explain all of my convictions and where they come from.

Here's a summary before we get into the details:
1. **Metaphysics:** there is a single, objective reality that exists independent of consciousness. Everything that exists exists in this one reality. Everything that exists has a specific identity and can only act according to that identity.

2. **Epistemology:** we are capable of understanding reality through **logic** and **reason**, which are faculties of our minds. Understanding reality begins with perception, which leads to concept formation.

    We perceive things -> we think about what we saw -> we form concepts by identifying essential characteristics -> we create a mental hierarchy (file system) of those concepts

3. **Ethics:** the goal of life is to **be happy**. Living and acting according to one's values and long-term goals is moral. Initiating force is immoral because it prevents others from living freely and achieving their happiness.

4. **Politics:** governments are necessary to protect human life and freedom. A government's only legitimate purposes are to establish:
    - a **military** to defend against foreign invaders
    - a **police** to defend against local violence or force
    - a **court system** to arbitrate disputes and ensure contracts are fulfilled

All other actions taken by government are immoral and invalid because they prevent individuals from acting freely and ultimately prevents them from achieving happiness.

*Laissez-faire capitalism* is the only system of government that protects rights. It is the only system that is consistent with man's nature and allows him to gain and keep his values. All other systems impede human action and prevent people from acting in their self-interests. Any intervention by the government (e.g. regulations, drug laws, etc.) is *immoral* and *destructive*.

## 💡 Metaphysics

Metaphysics (the nature of reality) is the foundation of philosophy. I consider Aristotle and Ayn Rand to be the greatest contributors to philosophy - I agree with their fundamental ideas on reality and human nature. Rand sums up metaphysics beautifully with her signature phrase: Existence exists. This may sound obvious, but it is essential to developing a consistent view of the world.

In fact, many modern philosophers and physicists argue that [objective reality does not exist](https://www.livescience.com/objective-reality-not-exist-quantum-physicists.html). Rejecting reality creates a weak philosophic foundation that leads to destructive ethical and political ideas. Everything else stems from acknowledging that there is a single, objective reality.

This leads to the concept of identity. Everything that exists has a specific nature and a specific set of characteristics. Rand summarizes this idea with her famous phrase "A is A."
In Metaphysics, Aristotle outlines his Law of Non-Contradiction:
> It is impossible that the same thing belong and not belong to the same thing at the same time and in the same respect.

Both Aristotle and Rand are correct. Identity is a necessary corollary to existence. In fact, it is an axiom; identity is self-evident and indisputable.

Modern philosophy disagrees (for me, this is all philosophy after Immanuel Kant). Modern philosophers claim that we cannot know the nature of reality and that there may very well be an infinite number of realities. This is a destructive foundation that leads to skepticism, determinism, and a subjective view of reality. With such a foundation, one cannot create a consistent moral code because determining what is right and wrong *depends on the nature of the world we exist in*. This leads us to epistemology, which deals with whether or not man is able to understand around him.

# 🧠 Epistemology

Epistemology is the theory of knowledge. What do we know? How do we know things? Is it even possible to know anything? These are the questions epistemology addresses.

Although we are fallible, *knowledge is attainable*. Knowledge is an understanding or grasp about a specific fact of reality. This can be something as simple as observation or the result of reasoning. For example, one can walk into the forest and see dozens of different trees - each tree has a different color bark, height, number of leaves, etc. Perceiving these trees is the simplest form of knowledge; you look at the trees around and now have a mental grasp on their existence. One can go further by abstracting away the general form of a tree. One can ignore the specific characteristics of each tree (i.e. ignore the leaf color, height, number of branches) and focus on what all of the trees share in common. Only then can one create the concept of a tree. This too is knowledge but at a higher, more complex level.

Most children can only gain knowledge on the perceptual level. But as we age and as our brain develops, we are able to understand patterns and categorize items, thus creating a mental file system of reality. This allows humans to build on prior knowledge and enables us to understand reality at a level no other animal can. Reason is why humans are able to create machines, develop constitutions, and build rockets. The luxuries we indulge in today are only possible because our minds are capable of understanding reality.

Man must use *reason*, a faculty of his mind, to take in the sensory data he perceives and to make rational decisions that are in his long-term self interest.

# ☮️ Ethics

Ethics is the code which drives our decisions and actions. All of us operate according to some code of ethics, even if we are not consciously aware of it. Ethics are necessary for man to live among one another; humans must live by a code of conduct because survival is not guaranteed. Food, water, and shelter are not given to us; man must think and act in order to gather and create the tools and resources to live. Plants do not need such a code because the nature of their existence is does not require it. Plants grow and respond automatically to stimuli - ethics are irrelevant and impossible to them (i.e. plants cannot develop a system of morality).

In order for us to survive and exist together, we must develop a code of existence. **The goal of existence is to be happy**, therefore our ethical system must allow for all humans to achieve their own happiness. A proper ethical system declares:
-  acting to gain or keep one's values is moral
- making decisions based on reason (i.e. based on knowledge of reality) is moral
- being confident in one's ability to understand reality is moral (i.e. self-respect and self-confidence is good and necessary to be happy)
- initiating force prevents people from living freely and is immoral
- acting against one's own self-interests is immoral
- making decisions on whims or emotions is immoral because it leads to destructive consequences that impedes one's happiness
- lying is immoral except when used in *self-defense* (e.g. lying to a murder who is asking where your friend is)

Being ethical requires acting to achieve your personal happiness. Setting long-term goals (personal and professional) and being productive (working to achieve those goals) are ethical because they are necessary for a happy life. Because humans have free will, some of them will act irrationally and will attempt to violate others by resorting to violence or manipulation. Because it is possible for people to initiate force, we must develop principles that protect and defend people so that they may live and prosper. This leads us to the final branch we will discuss, politics.

# 🏛️ Politics

Everything we have discussed leads us to politics, or as Rand says: "the principles of a proper social system." Politics is ethics in practice, or ethics applied to society.

Because humans have free will, we must have some body or entity that defends and protects individuals from those who wish to initiate force. *Government* is that entity - and it is necessary for a civilized society to exist. Without government (anarchy), everyone must defend for themselves - the most powerful and brutal tribe can act at will without any recourse. It is *impossible* for mankind to exist peacefully in a social context without government.

Rand explains in *The Virtue of Selfishness*:
> If physical force is to be barred from social relationships, men need an institution charged with the task of protecting their rights under an objective code of rules.
> This is the task of a government—of a proper government—its basic task, its only moral justification and the reason why men do need a government.
> *A government is the means of placing the retaliatory use of physical force under objective control*—i.e., under objectively defined laws.

The sole responsibility of a government is to *protect the rights of its citizens*. As I mentioned earlier, there are only three legitimate arms of a government:
- a military to defend against foreign invaders
- a police to defend against local violence or force
- a court system to arbitrate disputes and ensure contracts are fulfilled

These are both *necessary* and *sufficient* for a government to protect the rights of its citizens. There are thousands of other items we can discuss here like taxation, regulations, and economics - but I'll save those for another day as it is easy to get side-tracked with politics.

_____

In summary:

Metaphysics: a single, objective reality exists

Epistemology: our minds are capable of grasping reality

Ethics: set goals and work towards them to achieve happiness; do not initiate force and be honest

Politics: Laissez-fair capitalism, free of any regulations

Remember that no matter how violent and anarchic the world may seem, things can always get better. It will take some time - but the right ideas always win out in the end. We have reality on our side.
