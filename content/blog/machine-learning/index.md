This space will serves as a running list of notes from my journey to learn more about Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Both already [impact](https://www.tesla.com/autopilotAI) the world in a positive way - and I am confident ML and AI will continue to improve our standard of living. I plan to learn as much as possible so
that one day I may be able to contribute to a community that will, quite literally, change the world.

# ‚õ∞Ô∏è Long-Term Goals
I'm beginning with [Hands-On Maching Learning](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/), a book the ML community highly recommends. [Practical Statistics for Data Scientists
](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-statistics-for/9781491952955/) is another book I will reference along the way. I also had the pleasure of stumbling upon 
Victor Zhou's [website](https://victorzhou.com/), where he writes about both topics and many others.

- [x] Python basics
- [ ] Pandas
- [ ] Keras
- [ ] TensorFlow
- [ ] SciKit-learn


# üéØ Intermediate Goals
- [ ] Neural Networks (general principles)
- [ ] Convolutional neural networks
- [ ] Recurrent neural networks
