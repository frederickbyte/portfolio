Recent shutdowns due to COVID-19 have generated many arguments regarding the government's power and authority over its citizens.

Can local governments force us to wear masks in the name of protecting others? Should the federal gov't mandate vaccines for its citizens? Should my state gov't be able to close bars and schools and fine those who disobey local mandates?

Although most Americans support either temporary shutdowns or [mask mandates](https://apnews.com/9126a38ef22c244f9ca18f9584061f8d), some have taken their local government to court to challenge the new wave of strict laws in response to the spread of COVID-19.

In one [specific case](https://www.floridacivilrights.org/case-update-amended-complaint-filed-against-palm-beach-county/), a Florida judge ruled that not only are mask mandates legal, he declared that public interests are above individual rights. As we will discuss below, the judge claims that in times of crisis, people must temporarily surrender their rights and follow mandates in order to protect the community from disease or calamity.

This stance is patently absurd and immoral. After reading the judge's ruling, it is clear that not only does he fail to understand the nature of rights, he does even take them seriously. Judge John Kastrenakes, who presided over the case, considers rights important insofar as they serve the "public good." This case serves as a superb summary of how our culture views the individual and the group.

# Taking the government to court

In Florida, a group of citizens sued Palm Beach County over its mask mandate, calling it unconstitutional. The case is a result of Karen Holme, a Palm Beach County resident who is expressly exempt from wearing a mask due to a medical condition, was still expelled from a Palm Beach County Board meeting for not wearing one.

Citing Article I of the [Constitution](https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/article/article-i), the plaintiffs claimed that the "requirement to wear a facial covering in public spaces constitutes an impermissible intrusion into their private lives..." They believed that the government had no moral or legal right to force them to wear face coverings, regardless of how widespread COVID-19 was in the area.

From what I have read, this was the first major lawsuit filed by citizens against their local government. Being first is important in United States law; many courts rely on precedent to determine their outcomes.

# Judge rules in favor of the mandate

Unsurprisingly, the judge ruled in favor of the mandate. The judge's [ruling](https://www.wptv.com/news/region-c-palm-beach-county/judge-denies-attempt-to-quash-palm-beach-county-mask-mandate), however, is full of horrifying statements about the limits of individual freedom. His conclusion reads like a chapter out of George Orwell's *1984*.

In his conclusion, Judge Kastrenakes says (bold text is my own):

"... constitutional rights and the ideals of limited government **do not**... allow [a citizen] to wholly shirk their social obligation to their fellow Americans or to society as a whole."

Later, he asserts:

"After all, we do not have a constitutional or protected right to infect others."

Such a despicable statement can only come from someone who fails to understand rights. Judge Kastrenakes is equating not wearing a mask to forcefully infecting others. In that same paragraph, he compares not wearing a face covering to spreading STDs through intercourse without the consent of one's partner. By framing the non-use of face coverings as a violent act, the judge argues that anyone who refuses to cover their face is commuting a moral sin and directly threatens the community.

The mere possibility of unconsciously or unknowingly spreading a virus is **no justification** for governmental intrusion on individual lives. If so, why don't we institute a permanent mandate for face coverings? Why should we only worry about COVID-19, when millions of people die every year from cold, influenza, tuberculosis, and other diseases?

Government's proper role is to protect its citizens from the initiation of force, not to preemptively force them to cover their face and body in the name of "public health." Even if the data was conclusive on the effectiveness of face coverings to save lives, [which](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/which-countries-are-requiring-face-masks) it is [not](https://fortune.com/2020/07/29/no-point-in-wearing-mask-sweden-covid/?fbclid=IwAR07dGNRxNnSrF2nIm-vgC3gw9FYgN0ATtpOA0uzcAHiXCUMpTaBFlbtcjU), that still would not give government the moral or legal right to pass laws mandating face coverings.

Private businesses should have the right to choose whether or not to serve customers who wear masks. Individuals have the responsibility and freedom to determine whether or not they want to take extra precautions to defend against diseases. This is true not only now during the the spread of COVID-19, but also during flu season. Some people will choose to wear masks and limit their exposure to the public; others will not. The government has no role in forcing people or businesses to act in any particular way.

Near the end of his remarks, Judge Kastrenakes quotes Davis v. City of S. Bay as support for the mask mandate:

> There are circumstances in which a public emergency, for instance, a fire, **the spread of infectious or contagious diseases** or other potential public calamity, presents an exigent circumstance before which all private rights must > imediately give way under the government's police power.

Herein lies the essence of the judge's argument. If anything bad is happening in society, the government can say or do essentially whatever it wants so long as that action is in the name of the "public good." The government, according the judge and many of our politicians, has both the moral and legal responsibility to override individual rights in times of need.

What are *times of need?* Is this a small and limited scope in which the government can act? Nope. According to the courts: "any potential public calamity" which means: for anything and everything.

# Individual rights are objective and absolute

Judge Kastrenakes's ruling is a good summary for how our society views the rights of individuals in relationship to the community. Our country believes that individuals are below the group, which is why during times of adversity or hardship, rights are sacrificed in the name of helping the public. Ultimately, the courts say, citizens only have rights insofar as they align with the public interest. Once the public becomes sick or faces a tragic event, private rights go out the window.

Politicians and judges contend that living in a civilized society requires surrendering one's individual freedoms in order to live and interact publicly. But there is nothing more uncivilized and revolting than forcing individuals to kneel before gov't mandates in the supposed name of serving others. In order to live a happy, healthy, and prosperous life, each person must be free from intervention so that they can act according to their self-interests. This includes government intervention.

In summary:

1. all individuals have a right to their life
2. this right is absolute and cannot be surrendered under any circumstance
3. this right is independent of race, ethnicity, religion, and gender
4. individuals have the right to take action to maintain or improve their lives, so long as that action does not violate another person's life or property
5. any action by a government that limits an individual's freedom is **immoral and invalid**

By this standard, *any and all mask mandates are immoral*, regardless of what disease is spreading or how deadly it is. Even if masks were 100% effective against contracting COVID-19, that *still* does not give
government the authority to force its citizens to wear one.
Each of us should have the freedom and responsibility to decide whether or not to wear protective coverings or to take other precautions against the spread of infectious diseases.

Update: November 27 2020

This week, the Supreme Court [ruled 5-4](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a87_4g15.pdf) against New York governor Andrew Cuomo's mandate limiting group sizes in religious buildings. Although the justices based their decision more on pragmatism than on principle, Justice Neil Gorsuch at least paid some lip service to individual rights in his concurring opinion:

> _Government is not free to disregard the First Amendment in times of crisis._ At a minimum, that Amendment
> prohibits government officials from treating religious exercises worse than coparable secular activities, unless they
> are pursuing a compelling interest and using the least restrictive means available.
