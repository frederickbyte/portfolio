Other than your mind, the most powerful tool you possess is your **voice**. Representation in a free society is literally life or death - our lives sway in one direction or another depending on the quality of our public servants. I'm not trying to be hyperbolic. Who we elect into office directly impacts how much we pay in taxes, our social freedoms (drugs, guns, marriage, etc.), and our relationships with other countries (which affects the prices we pay on products other countries produce).

Unfortunately, many Americans are apathetic towards who represents us until the presidential election - by then it is too late. Every four years we complain about the low quality of candidates. But we choose who runs for office - we determine the ideas that the candidates argue over - we ultimately decide the path of our country. _A pool of awful political candidates is an indictment on us, the people_.

During elections, those who do vote tend to vote against a specific candidate rather than voting in favor of one. People say: "Well that guy's a crazy liberal so I'm going to vote for Trump" or "Well I think Trump is insane so I'll probably go with Biden even though I don't care for his policies." What does this even mean? What is the goal

Because our culture stands for nothing, it votes for nothing. Americans are voting against the candidate they hate most instead of voting for a candidate they love. This is, in large part, due to a lack of integrity and principle. One must have a set of objective guidelines to guide his voting decisions. Otherwise, we end up in the situation we have today: a rotten field of candidates that that do not stand up for individuality; disgusting candidates that few people like but will nonetheless vote for out of desperation.

# Defending rights is paramount

The primary question one must ask before voting is: **will this candidate work to make life freer**? Not for a specific race or gender, but _all_ people.

Presidents and Congressmen should operate according to a singular idea: protect individual rights. If a candidate deviates from his moral responsibility of protecting rights (e.g. by imposing regulations, taxation, or even through racist language), then one should condemn that and determine how egregious that deviation is. If a candidate grossly violates rights, then one should condemn that candidate and look to others for voting. Now this may sound simple in theory, but in reality all candidates violate rights to a certain degree. Therefore one must weigh each candidate's moral system and positions in order to determine whether or not to vote for them.

# How does this relate to Trump and Biden?

Although there are numerous presidential candidates, I will focus on Donald Trump and Joseph Biden for brevity. The principles we discuss apply to all candidates however.

First I will state the obvious: **neither Trump nor Biden want or plan to defend rights**. Both candidates advocate for policies that violate individual liberties, obstruct freedom, and prevent citizens from acting according to their own minds.

# Donald Trump

To begin, President Trump has made a few quality decisions that I agree with. These include either the undoing of poor decisions made by the Obama administration or the restoration of freedoms to corporations/individuals:

- [withdrawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_withdrawal_from_the_Paris_Agreement) the US from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017
- [abandoning](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/world/middleeast/trump-iran-nuclear-deal.html) the Iran nuclear deal in 2018
- [reversing](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html) some environmental regulations
- [passing](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1/text) the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017 (allowing individuals and businesses to keep more of the money they earn)

However the list of rights-violating, anti-individual policies and rhetoric vastly outnumbers the one above.

President Trump has [imposed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_tariffs#:~:text=As%20of%20January%202020%2C%20the,all%20U.S.%20imports%20in%202017) tariffs on goods entering the country, which has raised the price Americans pay for those items.

Trump also emphatically supported and signed the colossal COVID-19 [spending bill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/25/trump-senate-coronavirus-economic-stimulus-2-trillion/) that will add trillions to the national debt and will devalue the worth of the US dollar (inflation). Despite his campaign promise to balance the budget, Trump's policies have [increased our debt](https://www.thebalance.com/trump-plans-to-reduce-national-debt-4114401) by trillions in just his first four years.

The coronavirus bill was passed in the name of "saving the economy" - despite the fact that this bill (and others that he will eventually sign) only kicks the hyperinflation can further down the road and will increase the financial pain Americans will feel when the economy truly collapses. Anyone who believes that America is impervious to a genuine economic catastrophe should do a quick read on the Weimar Republic.

On multiple occasions, Trump [praised](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/408275-trump-praises-kim-jong-uns-courage-during-united-nations-address) Kim Jong-un, the mass murdering dictator of North Korea. A rational person would never praise such a disgusting individual as Kim.

Read this and ask yourself if it sounds like the words of a reasonable man:

> When somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total. And that's the way it's got to be. It's total.

Sounds like Richard Nixon, but the above quote is [from Trump](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-uses-coronavirus-briefing-airing-grievances-n1183081) during a coronavirus press conference in April. Republicans are persistent in their attempts to spin the meaning of Trump's rhetoric, but there is no defending his tweets or press conference dialog.

Trump also opposes abortion, a stance consistent with most Republicans. In fact, he attended and [spoke](https://apnews.com/1210f9012eec9818b25ac9abad46b955) at the March for Life rally in January of this year. *Being pro-life is anti-woman*. All women have a right to their body and subsequently the right to act on their bodies. This includes terminating their pregnancy.

Abortion is a massive issue;. But in short: pro-choice is the only moral position to take. Women have the right to terminate their pregnancies. Trump's position is an incorrect and immoral one.

The list continues, but the conclusion should be clear now: **Trump operates on immoral, contradictory ideas and his presidency is a direct threat to our individual rights**.

I consider voting for Trump to be immoral because it is an endorsement of someone who has not and will not defend rights as they properly should be. In fact, I believe Donald Trump will set a dangerous precedent because many Americans relate Trump with capitalism, which could not be further from the truth. I am afraid that by re-electing Trump, even more young Americans will turn away from the ideas of free markets and free trade, thus placing the final nail in the coffin of laissez-faire capitalism.

Capitalism is culturally on its last leg as very few people understand why it is a moral system. Americans may pay lip service to capitalism or claim to support it on some [anonymous poll](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6750229-200053-NBCWSJ-January-Poll.html). But the percentage of Americans in favor of a deregulated economic system where everyone is free to act according to their own mind and keep the money/capital they earn is minuscule at best (to my knowledge, no one has conducted a poll about laissez-faire capitalism). The conflation of Trump with capitalism will be devastating to America's future.

For those reasons, I consider the re-election of President Trump a detriment to all Americans because we will suffer four more years of anti-individual legislation and rhetoric.

I will **not** be voting for Donald Trump in November.

# What about Joe Biden?

Joseph Biden, the presumptive Democratic candidate, will be Trump's strongest competitor (I do not think that [Jo Jorgensen](https://joj2020.com/), the Libertarian Party candidate, has a legitimate shot).

Despite the altruistic foundation of his philosophic system, Biden supports some social policies that are consistent with human freedom, including:

- legalization of marijuana (although he [advocates](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/06/joe-biden-legalize-marijuana-111642) for states to regulate the substance, which I consider immoral)
- elimination of past convictions relating to marijuana (because current drug laws are immoral and invalid, anyone convicted of violating those laws should have those records expunged immediately)
- women's right to abortion (pro-choice)

But like Trump, Biden advocates for many disastrous policies. One could argue that Biden's policies will be more harmful to Americans than Trump's, as Biden plans to massively increase the regulation of business, specifically the energy sector.

Biden [vows to ban](https://www.ontheissues.org/2020/Joe_Biden_Energy_+_Oil.htm) new offshore oil and gas drilling as well as add strong regulations to fracking. Government intervention into the economy is immoral and detrimental to both businesses and individuals. It prevent companies from acting freely, thus stifling the invention of newer, more efficient technologies which hurts the consumer (i.e. you and I). The less something is regulated, the cheaper it is and the faster it evolves.

This is why smartphones and computers have become so powerful yet so cheap compared to the medical industry which is inundated with regulations. Medical technologies, hospital visits, and drugs are exorbitantly expensive because the field are *not* free - government has control over all corners of the medical field.

Biden's energy regulations will only make gas, oil, and electricity more expensive and less accessible to Americans. No good will come from his domestic energy policies. Forcing the country to convert to all-electric will be devastating. Government has no role in telling people what types of energy they should consume - this decision is up to each individual person.

Biden also [plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/us/politics/biden-backs-free-college.html) to make college "tuition-free" for at least two years and relieve student loan debt. I add quotes around "tuition-free" because the money must be confiscated from taxpayers in order to fund the program (just like any government program). Like the energy sector, government should have no role in the education system.

Little needs to be said about how poisonous the public education system is. Despite the fact that America [spends more](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=66#:~:text=How%20much%20money%20does%20the,constant%202017%E2%80%9318%20dollars).) on public education than ever before, quality continues to decline.

Increasing the volume of money will only exacerbate the problem. The government should not intervene in the education of our children just as it should not intervene in gas, oil, or electricity. We could discuss education for hours, but what's important is the principle: **government has no place in education and no place in the financing of education**.

Biden believes that [healthcare](https://joebiden.com/healthcare/) is a right and that the federal government should provide a basic level of healthcare to all Americans. He wants to build on the Affordable Care Act and ultimately transition to a completely public healthcare system.

I emphatically believe that **healthcare is not a right**. Government intervention into the healthcare system has destroyed any potential innovation and has made simple procedures and hospital visits [prohibitively expensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_prices_in_the_United_States) for many people. Tightening government's grasp on healthcare will only worsen its quality and increase its price.

I'm afraid to imagine just how devastating a public healthcare system would be. The amount of wealth that must be confiscated to pay for such a system is astronomical and will undoubtedly cause serious economic damage.

Like Trump, I consider the election of Joseph Biden to be a direct threat to individual liberty because all of his major policies involve government interference in to the lives of individuals and businesses. Biden, to my knowledge, has not advocated for the elimination of any regulation or for the freeing of any sector of the economy. He only advocates for larger government, for more legislation, and for a more centralized control of the economy.

Biden's campaign will result in decreased liberty for individual Americans and enormous growth in government.

I will **not** be voting for Joseph Biden in November.

# What to do in November?

At this moment, I do not plan to vote for any presidential candidate because they all violate the fundamental principles we discussed previously. It is only June, there is still time for a reasonable candidate to appear from the shadows. But considering the current state of our culture, I will not be getting my hopes up. This election will come down to Trump or Biden, and I want no part in the voting of either candidate.

Imagine if someone asked you "Hey do you want to beat your wife or your daughter?" The only logical and moral answer is "Neither!" If both options are equally egregious, then walking away is the best choice.

As Rush says in their song Freewill: "If you choose not to decide you still have made a choice."

I believe we should continue advocating for good ideas and denouncing bad ones (i.e advocating for individualism, freedom, and reason). But do not let the public pressure you into voting just for the sake of doing so.

People will cry out "Just vote - it's your patriotic duty!" Peikoff said in advance of the 2006 midterm elections:

> Given the choice between a rotten, enfeebled, despairing killer [Democrats], and a rotten, ever stronger, and ambitious killer [Republicans], it is immoral to vote for the latter, and equally immoral to refrain from voting at all because "both are bad."

I must disagree with Peikoff here. I consider it both immoral and impractical to vote for either killer. The most reasonable course of action is to denounce both candidates and advocate for good ideas.

In the end, ideas are what change a culture. Changing a culture changes the quality of the candidates that run for office.

Ideas change the world, for better or worse. Bad ideas are why America is in the situation it is in now. Only the right ideas can dig us out of this hole. Only the right ideas can lead us towards freedom, health, and prosperity.

It is up to us to decide where we go from here.

PS: I highly suggest listening to Leonard Peikoff's [brilliant talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qhf7J6lcO4) on the 1992 presidential election, where he describes in depth the principles that guide his voting.
