The Senate Judiciary Committee recently [discussed and released](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3398) the EARN IT Act - an immoral, misguided, and dangerous bill. Its co-sponsors, Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), claim the Act will protect children by establishing a National Commission on Online Child Sexual Exploitation Prevention. But this is not the primary objective of the bill, merely a misdirection. Politicians often use flowery prose to hide their dangerous plans, offering fig leaves that entice voters to support their egregious rights-violating bills. This bill is another such instance.

The National Commission will not solve the problem of child sex trafficking. The Commission is a tool granting government both the authority to guide business and user behavior online and to read and collect user content to scan for suspicious content. Senators will use this bill as leverage during their town halls when trying to convince their delegation that they truly care about children. In reality, [EARN IT](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/s3398/BILLS-116s3398is.pdf) will not make children safer. EARN IT is not about online safety, but about control.

EARN IT “directs the commission to develop best practices for interactive online services providers” and “requires interactive online service providers to certify compliance with the best practices.”

Its purpose is not to protect rights or property, but to *strengthen the federal government’s grip on the internet and to make it easier for the gov’t to censor individuals and companies online*.

EARN IT also forces platforms to adhere to the “best practices” set by the Commission, else face threats of censorship or other penalties. Equally frightening is the bill’s threat to encryption.

There is no question that sex trafficking is a morally evil act and an egregious crime. But that does not give politicians carte blanche to administer sweeping legislation that, in essence, will surrender the web to the federal government.

In summary, I consider this bill immoral and destructive because it:

1. increases government's control over the internet
2. allows the federal gov't to force businesses to follow "best practices"
3. allows the federal gov't to force platforms to scan and submit user content, regardless of the user's consent
4. prevents individuals and companies from acting and conducting themselves freely on the internet

EARN IT will not make the web safer for children - it will only tighten the government's hold on the web.

# The bill sabotages end-to-end encryption

Encryption is a brilliant technical creation that has afforded people the comfort and safety of storing and transferring sensitive information across the web and between electronic devices. Many Congressmen, especially Republicans, blame encryption for the transmission of illegal documents and for the execution of sexual crimes (they argue that encryption prevents law enforcement from spying on and catching would-be criminals). Attorney General William Barr has [opposed](https://www.wsj.com/articles/barrs-encryption-push-is-decades-in-the-making-but-troubles-some-at-fbi-11579257002) private encryption for some time, and while serving as Attorney General in 1992, the Justice Department and Drug Enforcement Agency conducted a surveillance program in which the agency confiscated billions of phone records with little oversight from Congress. That program was a clear violation of individual rights and privacy – the EARN IT Act will lead to a similar result.

Barr and others will likely us EARN IT as a tool to begin a [surveillance program](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/28/review-finds-phone-data-dragnet-dea-doj-began-without-legal-review/3299438002/) not of phone calls, but of online comments and posts. The bill will allow Congress to force companies such as Microsoft and Apple to add backdoor channels into their operating systems. Graham and other supporters of EARN IT claim that such a backdoor is necessary for the gov't to access evidence in the case of a terrorist or online sex trafficking scheme.

Regardless, government has no moral right to tell a business what kind of software it should produce. This bill allows the federal gov't to coerce software companies to include certain features in their products in the name of “public safety.” This is a violation of rights. Child safety and national security are no justification for the gov't forcing businesses and individuals to act in a certain way.

# The bill will force platforms to proactively scan content

Under EARN IT, the Commission will likely coerce social media sites and forums to scan user content to search for illegal information (e.g. child sex trafficking, child pornography). Currently, companies do not have to proactively scan content. But if a company [obtains](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A) such illegal content, they must report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children’s (NCMEC) CyberTipline. However, EARN IT will force platforms to scan content without warrant or probable cause, a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment.

Child sex trafficking is something _all_ reasonable men should vehemently oppose, and I do. But this bill will not make children safer - it will only decrease the rights of those who browse the internet and those who conduct business online.

# Speak out against EARN IT whenever possible

All of us should vocally oppose EARN IT whenever possible, as it poses a direct threat to our individual freedom and to the freedoms of private businesses. **Government should have no role in telling individuals and corporations how to act or conduct themselves online**. Thankfully, much of the tech community is expressing serious opposition to this bill. I hope that you will too.
